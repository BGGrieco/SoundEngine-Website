# SoundEngine-Website
My first ever project.

My first ever web development project. Multiple page, very "90s style". I am still working on this, as it 
is a personal website for my Sound Design services. Features '<iframes>' for the portfolio section, fully adaptive design
right down to mobile screen size, and a contact form with e-mail checking regex. Original version featured a GoogleMap
to get more marks, removed in this version. Planning on some CSS animations to add next.
